# Package Version Checking

Before suggesting `npm install` (or `pnpm install`, `yarn add`, etc.) for any package, always check the latest available version first.

## Process

1. **Check available versions** using:
   ```bash
   npm view <package-name> versions
   ```
   Or for the latest version only:
   ```bash
   npm view <package-name> version
   ```

2. **Recommend the most recent stable version** explicitly in the install command:
   ```bash
   npm install <package-name>@<latest-version>
   ```

3. **Avoid suggesting** generic install commands without version numbers unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Example

❌ **BAD**: 
```
npm install react-query
```

✅ **GOOD**: 
```bash
# First check: npm view react-query version
npm install react-query@5.17.0
```

This ensures users always get the latest stable version and helps prevent version-related issues.
