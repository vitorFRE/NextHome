# Code Validation Before Finalization

Before suggesting or finalizing any code changes, always run the following validation checks:

## Required Checks

1. **Run lint check**:

   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

   Or if the script doesn't exist:

   ```bash
   npx eslint .
   ```

2. **Run TypeScript type check**:

   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

3. **Run build (if applicable)**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Only run this if the project has a build script and it's relevant to the changes made.

## Process

- Execute these checks **before** presenting final code to the user
- If any check fails, fix the issues before finalizing
- Report any errors found and resolve them
- Only mark code as complete after all checks pass

## Exception

If the user explicitly requests to skip validation or is working on a draft/WIP, you may proceed, but always mention that validation should be run before merging/deploying.
